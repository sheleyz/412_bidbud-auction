I stopped by his enclosure and he prepared for his portrait sitting by arranging his bedding with a blanket thrown over the top. Then he gets as close to the window as he can, to watch me paint. Fortunately, I had the basic structure down when he stood up and turned his back to everyone. He has so much personality and has recognized me throughout the years. The Paint Out event isn't complete without revisiting an old friend, who is loved by so many.",

I was intrigued with their form of prehistoric looking heads upon a heavy, rather nondescript body. Such a small interesting portion of their bodies, the head. I spent a couple hours trying to sketch and paint one bird. They certainly chased and scurried about the enclosure the entire time I painted.",

I included the spring buds and blossoms that surrounded us as a sign of hope and optimism.",

Portraying the human experience, he hopes to capture not only the beauty of the human form but the emotion. He strives to capture the subtleties of expression, the power and the passion – pulled out of the cold, earthy material from which he works."
